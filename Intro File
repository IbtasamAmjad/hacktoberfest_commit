Example of FCFS scheduling

A real-life example of the FCFS method is buying a movie ticket on the ticket counter. In this scheduling algorithm, a person is served according to the queue manner. The person who arrives first in the queue first buys the ticket and then the next one. This will continue until the last person in the queue purchases the ticket. Using this algorithm, the CPU process works in a similar manner.
